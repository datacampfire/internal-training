## About Data Campfire
Data Campfire has been created by Natalie and Chloe. Our vision is to make working with data more accessible.

We met each other during our Masters in Digital Experience Design at Hyper Island Manchester. Data Campfire was started as a project during the programme (Winter 2015) with support from FutureEverything. We have taken steps to design the right thing; interviewing people who are interested in data to understand their needs, interviewing data publishers to understand what would encourage them to publish quality data, creating prototypes to make ideas tangible and get feedback from people and finally and iterating to make sure it meets the needs of our users.
This process has been documented in our Medium publication and the two prototypes that we created before this site can be viewed below.

In June 2016 we were accepted onto The S Factory, a Start-Up pre-accelerator run by Start-Up Chile. Following this we joined Bethnal Green Ventures back in London, an accelerator for start-ups for social good. In February 2017, we are pleased to be joining the second stage of the Start-Up Chile programme, having been accepted onto their Seed stage program.
